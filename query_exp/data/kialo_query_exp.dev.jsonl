Abortions up to 15 weeks are allowed in rape or incest cases, providing the victim submits certain proof. Punishable as a 3rd degree felony (2nd degree in death of the mother). Physicians must report rape or incest of a minor. No telehealth abortion services. No government funds for travel to another state to support an abortion; exceptions for physical medical emergencies.", "This bill severely limits a woman's right to choose by restricting abortion to only six weeks of gestation, except in the case of physical medical emergencies. It further encroaches on personal rights by requiring victims of rape or incest to provide certain proof to be allowed abortions up to 15 weeks. The third degree felony punishment for violations seems excessively punitive. Restrictions on telehealth abortion services and lack of government funds for out-of-state abortions, except for physical medical emergencies, could disproportionally affect low-income, rural women."]}
