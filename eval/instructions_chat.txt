Document: [Doc 1]
Statement: [Doc 2]
Instruction: Does the document support the statement? Answer with only "Yes" or "No". 
Only consider the information provided in the document, and do not infer any additional information. 
The document is a snippet taken from the Internet, and might exhibit support for or opposition against the statement.
If the document opposes the statement, the answer is "No". If the document does not contain relevant information about the statement, the answer is also "No".
The answer is "Yes" only if the document supports the statement, either explicitly or implicitly.
Think carefully if the document actually supports the statement, or if there is just some superficial textual overlap between the two.
